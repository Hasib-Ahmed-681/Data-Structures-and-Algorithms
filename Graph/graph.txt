#graph represent connected object
#graph consist of nodes and edges
#tree is a kind of a graph
#graph dnt have root node
# node = vertex
# if 2 node is directly connected = Adjacent
# if graph have a direction = directed graph
# edges also have a weight
# weight represent how strong the connection is



# represent a graph using a matrix

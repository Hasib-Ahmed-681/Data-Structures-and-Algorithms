there are two type of traverse in trees

Breadth first
level order traverse
shalowest node = line by line

Depth first
1 inorder   (left,root,right) # value comes out ascending order
2 pre-order (root,left,right)
3 post-order (left,right,root) # visit leaf node first


BinaryTree height = longest path
1+ max(height(L) , height(R)) --> Height formula
use post order
visit all the leaf first


Minimum Value in Binary BinaryTree
post order
